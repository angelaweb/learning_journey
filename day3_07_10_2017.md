Day 3 already...

I've spent the last week looking at every website in a whole new light, using the inspector to see how they have been put together. Some of the code I've seen is beyond my capabilites (at the moment) but I'm getting an understanding of how developers use div classes to section their websites.

I see design inspiration whever I look: restuarants, tube stations, other websites. I'm thinking of colours, textures, patterns, fonts. If I see something that inspires me, I start thinking of what colours will compliment it? Wow, I'm sounding like a designer! I am so excited about starting this next phase of my life.

Today we learnt about positioning (do not build layouts with positioning - use flex-box instead wherever possible). I found positioning difficult, I can't remember the values so I will add these to my cheat-sheet as they are used for Navigations.

The element is relative to its ORIGINAL position
    position: relative;
