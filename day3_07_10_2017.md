Day 3 already...

I've spent the last week looking at every website in a whole new light, using the inspector to see how they have been put together. Some of the code I've seen is beyond my capabilites (at the moment) but I'm getting an understanding of how developers use div classes to section their websites.

I see design inspiration whever I look: restuarants, tube stations, other websites. I'm thinking of colours, textures, patterns, fonts. If I see something that inspires me, I start thinking of what colours will compliment it? Wow, I'm sounding like a designer! I am so excited about starting this next phase of my life.

Today we learnt about positioning (do not build layouts with positioning - use flex-box instead wherever possible). Lots of different values, I will have to study these more at home to understand what they do.

Then...drumroll... we starting working on our 1st project!!
I had to draw a wireframe and show it to the teacher, then start to build it. I was upset when it was time to go home as I was enjoying it so much, seeing my idea come to life on the screen. I will continue to work on it in the next week
