Day 2...

Today we learnt about CSS

We looked at csszengarden.com to show how CSS can change the entire look of a website. This is my favourite:

I learnt that CSS has rulesets:

selector{
    
    property: value;
}

Today's class has taught me a lot more about design and how importnat it is - I'll never look at a website in the same way again!
