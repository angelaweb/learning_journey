Day 2...

Today we learnt about CSS

We looked at csszengarden.com to show how CSS can change the entire look of a website. I was amazed at how different they all looked, I've done a lot of exercises on CSS online previously, but these exercises were: "make the border 1px solid green"  This is my favourite:

I learnt that CSS has rulesets:

selector{
    
    property: value;
}

I understand why we give HTML tags classes. As my teacher said keep it DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself!

Today's class has taught me a lot more about design and how important it is - I'll never look at a website in the same way again!
