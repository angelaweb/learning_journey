Day 2...

Today we learnt about CSS

We looked at csszengarden.com to show how CSS can change the entire look of a website. I was amazed at how different they all looked, I've done a lot of CSS exercises online previously, but these exercises were: "make the border 1px solid green", hard to translate it to 'real' web design. This is my favourite page on csszengarden.com:

I learnt that CSS has rulesets:

selector{
    
    property: value;
}

What else did I learn..?

Eric Meyer's reset - thank you Eric Meyer! No online course has taught me this, this is one of the benefits of having proper tuition, you learn time-saving tips like this. There is nothing wrong with learning online, some of the free courses are amazing for learning rules but nothing beats knowledge handed-down from someone with years of experience.

Now I get why we give HTML tags classes, it avoids repetition in CSS. As my teacher said keep it DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself!

Today's class has taught me a lot more about design and how important it is - I'll never look at a website in the same way again!
