Today I started the first chapter in my new life and started training to become a web designer.
After months of research, I decided that a classroom-based course would work best for me. I'd tried a few online tutorials at home - easy-peasy - but these don't give you 'real' scenarios, only a problem that has to be solved there and then.

So.... day 1... how did I feel? Nervous, excited, apprehensive... Can I do this, can I do this???
Today I learnt about HTML, lots of new terminology I have to get used to... tags, block elements, divs, anchors, etc
Wow! So much to take in... I understood it all (I think), the teacher is great, explains things in simple terms and really patient
